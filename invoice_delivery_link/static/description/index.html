        This module creates a link between delivery orders and their invoices, which usually come from sales orders. Now, you can easily see which deliveries are connected to an invoice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally, if you deliver part of an order and invoice it, then deliver the rest and invoice that, it's hard to tell which invoice is for which delivery. You only see the amounts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This module helps solve that problem. It's really useful if you invoice deliveries separately and want to show on the invoice report which delivery each part of the invoice is for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, this link works for products that you invoice when they are delivered.
